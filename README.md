CS33 Midterm Project

Here is my midterm files. Please use the musicserver.py server file rather than the other in the other server. That was just a placeholder to run some tests.

I didn't quite get everything working, particularly the usage of templates at the end and the AJAX calls that search spotify's catalog, but I tried to include comments in the code to indicate my thought process and what I was trying to accomplish with each function, if they are not entirely debugged.
